# Loan Renewal Prediction
ABN AMRO relationship managers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have a large client portfolio. This makes it difficult to keep track of their clients. As a result, we mostly serve SMEs in a reactive manner. ABN AMRO wants to help relationship managers to better serve their clients. This might include automatic recommendations: which clients to contact, so our service becomes proactive instead of reactive.
A common client request is a (renewal on their) business loan. As part of the MVP, we want to use machine learning to suggest to our relationship managers which customers are likely to apply for (renewal of) a credit, and when they are likely to do so. The goal is a solution to help relationship managers to serve their customers more proactively.
